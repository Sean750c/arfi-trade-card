# Mobile App Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive optimization strategy to improve page navigation performance and reduce APK size for the AfriTrade mobile application. The plan targets specific performance bottlenecks and implements industry best practices for mobile app optimization.

## Current State Analysis

### Performance Issues Identified
1. **Navigation Lag**: Transitions between tabs and pages show noticeable delays
2. **Memory Usage**: High memory consumption during navigation
3. **Bundle Size**: Large APK size affecting download and installation times
4. **Image Loading**: Inefficient image handling and caching

### Bundle Size Analysis
- Current estimated APK size: ~25-30MB
- Target reduction: 30% (8-9MB reduction)
- Main contributors to size:
  - React Native core libraries
  - Image assets
  - JavaScript bundle
  - Third-party dependencies

## 1. Page Navigation Performance Optimization

### Current Navigation Issues
- Heavy components loading synchronously
- Lack of proper screen preloading
- Inefficient state management during transitions
- Missing lazy loading implementation

### Optimization Strategy

#### A. Implement Lazy Loading for Tab Content
```typescript
// Lazy load tab screens to reduce initial bundle size
const HomeScreen = lazy(() => import('../(tabs)/index'));
const SellScreen = lazy(() => import('../(tabs)/sell'));
const WalletScreen = lazy(() => import('../(tabs)/wallet'));
const ProfileScreen = lazy(() => import('../(tabs)/profile'));
```

#### B. Screen Preloading Strategy
- Preload next likely screens based on user behavior
- Implement intelligent caching for frequently accessed screens
- Use background loading for heavy components

#### C. Navigation Configuration Optimization
- Enable `lazy: true` for all tab screens
- Implement proper `initialNumToRender` for lists
- Use `removeClippedSubviews` for long lists

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Navigation Optimization (Week 1)
1. Implement lazy loading for all tab screens
2. Add screen transition optimizations
3. Configure proper navigation options

#### Phase 2: Advanced Performance (Week 2)
1. Implement screen preloading
2. Add intelligent caching
3. Optimize list rendering performance

#### Phase 3: Monitoring and Fine-tuning (Week 3)
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement metrics collection
3. Fine-tune based on real-world data

## 2. APK Size Reduction Strategy

### Target Optimizations

#### A. Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports
- Split large components into smaller chunks
- Implement dynamic imports for non-critical features
- Use React.lazy() for heavy screens

#### B. Asset Optimization
- Compress all images using modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement progressive image loading
- Remove unused assets

#### C. Dependency Optimization
- Audit and remove unused dependencies
- Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- Implement tree shaking

#### D. Build Configuration
- Enable ProGuard for Android
- Implement Android App Bundle (AAB)
- Configure proper build optimizations

### Size Reduction Targets

| Category | Current Size | Target Size | Reduction |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| JavaScript Bundle | ~8MB | ~5MB | 37.5% |
| Images/Assets | ~6MB | ~3MB | 50% |
| Native Libraries | ~12MB | ~10MB | 16.7% |
| **Total** | **~26MB** | **~18MB** | **30.8%** |
